# Quant
A collection of my implementations and tests of various methods and tools used in quantitative finance. Based on project work suggested in the book 'The Concepts and Practice of Mathematical Finance' by Mark S. Joshi. My goal is to understand the intricacies of implementing quantitative methods and models in Python through my own experience. This will be a growing library of code and documentation that I hope to use for analysing financial data, and building and evaluating my own models.

## Current Progress: 
- Efficient calculation of Standard Normal CDF and its inverse
- Analytical pricing of derivatives
- Efficient geometric Brownian motion simulation
- Monte Carlo pricing of derivatives

## Next Steps:
- Further validation and documentation of Monte Carlo pricer
- Implement Greeks, Analytical and Monte Carlo
